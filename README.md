# PhysicsCar
a simple, low friction, 3-wheel car powered by mousetrap (or other stuff) for teaching physics concepts.

Created using FreeCAD. STL files are exported from FreeCAD.

In addition to the following 3d printed parts, you'll need:

 * (4) 4.8mm x 30cm (3/16" x 11-7/8") wood dowels
 * (1) 1.95mm x 915mm (0.078" x 36") piano wire
 * (8) #6 x 1/2" wood screws
