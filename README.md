# PhysicsCar
A simple, low friction, 3-wheel car powered by mousetrap (or other stuff) for teaching physics concepts.

Created using FreeCAD. STL files are exported from FreeCAD.

## Additional parts

In addition to the following 3d printed parts, you'll need:

 * (4) 4.8mm x 30cm (3/16" x 11-7/8") wood dowels
 * (1) 1.95mm x 915mm (0.078" x 36") piano wire
 * (8) #6 x 1/2" wood screws
 * (2) #6 x 1" machine screws
 * (2) #6 machine nuts (nylock or use Loctite blue)
 * (1) length of fishing wire, >= 6lb test
 * (1) standard mousetrap e.g., Victor

## Assembly

### Frame
  * Push two rods into front crossmember about halfway.
  * Push other end of these two rods into the inner holes of the middle crossmember just
enough so their ends are flush with the other side of the crossmember.
  * Push two new rods into the outer holes of the middle crossmember just enough so their
ends are flush with the other side of the crossmember.
  * Push front trap mount onto rear rods
  * Insert trap into front trap mount so, when sprung, arm is to the rear.
  * Push rear trap mount onto rear rods and push onto rear of trap
  * Push rear crossmember onto rods a few inches
  * Push the rod ends onto ends of each rod

###Wheels
  * Insert wire, which will become rear axle, into rear rod end holes
  * Push rear wheels, hub inboard, onto each axle end
  * Push hub onto each end of the axle. Adjust for stable, low friction spin
  * Trim axle length
  * Use #6 wood screws to attach drive flanges to drive wheel
  * Hold drive wheel/flanges in between front rod ends
  * Push another wire through one rod end, through drive wheel, and through other rod end.
  * Push hub onto each end of the axle. Adjust for stable, low friction spin
  * Trim axle length

###Pull rod
  * Use the #6 machine screws and nuts to loosely attach clamp onto the mouse trap arm
  * Insert pull rod into clamp
  * Insert pull rod end onto end of pull rod
  * Tie fishing wire onto pull rod end
  * Attach fishing line to drive flange.
  * Rotate drive wheel to spool up fishing line and hold it to keep from rotating
  * Place on ground, release drive wheel, and zoom! :)
